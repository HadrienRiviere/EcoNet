# EcoNet
This project has been conducted within the frama of a course at Goergia Institute of Technology. 
The course reference is CS8803 Mobile Applications and Services. 
Duuring this class, we are asked to prepare by the end of the semester, a working Learning Prototype as a mobile application. We have the choice of the framework, subject and organization within the group. 

# Idea 
The service tries to answer a problematic : a lot of persons are getting overwhelmed by the amount of information about how to improve their behavior in regard to the environnement issues. 
The application tries to answer that issue, by allowing the user to build a dashboard containing all the habits to track on a daily basis. 
Here are a few features developed : 
   - Habit tracker as a list on the main activity 
   - Creating a new habit to implement from the database provided by the community
   - Being able to track on a daily basis how many times the user did each habit
   - Forum sorted by subjects

# Improvements
Here are a few improvements that we thought about : 
   - Implement a challenge feature : two users would be able to challenge one another on a specific topic
   - Keep track on the improvement in the user's behavior based on their statistics
   - More interaction among the community and allow communication between users (message, chat rooms...)
   
   
# Project's implementation : 
   - Defining the problem : Most of the non-eco friendly behavior are due to the lack of information, or overwhelming processes
   - Defining the user-cases : From beginner in eco-friendly initiatives, to expert, each user can help the community get better
   - Building a mock-up with Adobe XD
   - Development with Android Studio : Front-end development of the application in Java and XML, with a precise color palette, and few activities
   - Development with Python Falcon API hosted by Google Cloud Platforms : Rest API definition in Python
   - No-SQL database hosted by Firebase
